Jellyvision take home exercise

# Goal
- Write a program to access GitHubʼs public API for a user (ie ge0ffrey )
- For each repo that the user has contributed to recently:
  - Find their 3 most common activity types. (e.g. commits, pull requests, comments, merges…)
  - Within that recent activity, flag any repos that the user owns
